# Mini Project 8: Travel History Tracker

This Python project allows users to track and analyze their travel history using **tuples**. It collects city names and visit years, then displays a formatted report including:

- Full travel history with city and year
- Year-based search for visits
- First visited city
- Most recent city in the list

### Concepts Used:
- Tuples
- Lists
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- User input handling

### How to Run
1. Run the script in any Python environment.
2. Enter the number of places visited.
3. Provide the city name and year of visit for each.
4. Enter a year to search for visits made in that year.
