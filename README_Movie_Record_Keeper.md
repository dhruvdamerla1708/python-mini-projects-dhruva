# 🎬 Mini Project 9: Movie Record Keeper

## 📌 Objective:
Build a simple movie database app using Python **tuples and lists** to store and manage movie data.

## 💡 Features:
- ✅ Add movie details: name, release year, and rating
- ✅ Store as tuples in a list
- ✅ Display all stored movies
- ✅ Identify and show the top-rated movie
- ✅ Menu-driven with match-case logic

## 🧠 Concepts Used:
- Tuples
- Lists
- Loops
- Indexing
- Conditional logic
- `match-case` structure

## 🚀 How It Works:
1. **User Menu**: Choose from Add, Display, Top Rated, or Exit
2. **Tuple Packing**: Each movie is stored as a tuple
3. **Top Rated**: Searches for the highest rating in the list
4. **Display**: Neatly formatted output of movies

## 🏁 Output Sample:
```
===== Movie Record Keeper =====
1. Add a movie
2. Display all movies
3. Top-Rated Movie
4. Exit
```

## 📂 File Structure:
- `movie_record_keeper.py` → Main project file
- `README.md` → Project explanation and documentation
