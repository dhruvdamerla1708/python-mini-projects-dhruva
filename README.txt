# Error Logger App

## Overview
The **Error Logger App** is a simple Python program that allows users to:
- Simulate runtime errors (like ZeroDivisionError or ValueError)
- Log error messages to a file (`error_log.txt`)
- View the saved error logs

## Features
1. Input-based simulation of arithmetic operations
2. Automatic error capturing and logging with timestamps
3. Option to view logged errors
4. Graceful handling of unexpected exceptions

## How to Use
1. Run the script.
2. Choose from the menu:
   - `1` to simulate an error
   - `2` to view the error log
   - `3` to exit
3. When simulating, enter two numbers. If the input or operation causes an error, it will be logged.

## Files Generated
- `error_log.txt`: Automatically created if any error occurs.

Enjoy debugging with logs like a pro!
